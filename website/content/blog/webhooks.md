title: Webhooks have arrived
---
The concept of a WebHook is simple. A WebHook is an HTTP callback: an HTTP request that occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification via HTTP.

A web application implementing WebHooks will make a request to a URL when certain things happen. When a web application enables users to register their own URLs, the users can then extend, customize, and integrate that application with their own custom extensions or even with other applications around the web. For the user, WebHooks are a way to receive valuable information when it happens, rather than continually polling for that data and receiving nothing valuable most of the time. WebHooks have enormous potential and are limited only by your imagination! (No, it can't wash the dishes. Yet.)

That is why we are so glad to announce **Saleina CMS** will now notify a URL of your choice when certain actions are performed by a user. You can read more about it in the [Docs](/docs/configuration-options/#hooks).
